    A school is an educational institution designed to provide learning spaces and learning environments for the teaching
     of students (or "pupils") under the direction of teachers. Most countries have systems of formal education, which is 
     sometimes compulsory.[2] In these systems, students progress through a series of schools. The names for these schools
      vary by country (discussed in the Regional section below) but generally include primary school for young children and 
      secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education. An institution where higher education is taught,
       is commonly called a university college or university.

In addition to these core schools, students in a given country may also attend schools before and after primary (Elementary 
in the US) and secondary (Middle school in the US) education. Kindergarten or preschool provide some schooling to very
 young children (typically ages 3–5). University, vocational school, college or seminary may be available after secondary
  school. A school may be dedicated to one particular field, such as a school of economics or a school of dance. 
  Alternative schools may provide nontraditional curriculum and methods.

Non-government schools, also known as private schools[3] may be required when the government does not supply adequate, or 
specific educational needs. Other private schools can also be religious, such as Christian schools, gurukula (Hindu School), madrasa (Arabic schools), hawzas (Shi'i Muslim schools), yeshivas (Jewish schools), and others; or schools that have a higher standard of education or seek to foster other personal achievements. Schools for adults include institutions of corporate training, military education and training and business schools.
